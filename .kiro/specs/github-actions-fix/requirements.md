# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GitHub Actions workflows for the whisper-video-to-text project need to be fixed to ensure proper CI/CD functionality. The current workflows have several issues including Python version compatibility problems, missing development dependencies, incorrect dependency installation commands, and potential security concerns with the mirroring workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI workflow to test against the correct Python versions, so that I can ensure compatibility with the project's requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CI workflow runs THEN the system SHALL test against Python versions 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 only
2. WHEN testing Python versions THEN the system SHALL NOT include Python 3.8 since the project requires Python >=3.9
3. WHEN the workflow matrix is defined THEN the system SHALL use the correct Python version format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI workflow to properly install dependencies using uv, so that the build process is reliable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use `uv sync --all-extras` to install all optional dependencies
2. WHEN uv is not available THEN the system SHALL install uv using the official installer
3. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL include both core and development dependencies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI workflow to include proper linting and code quality checks, so that code standards are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running linting THEN the system SHALL check if ruff and black are available before running them
2. WHEN linting tools are not installed THEN the system SHALL install them as development dependencies
3. WHEN code quality checks fail THEN the system SHALL fail the workflow appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Docker workflow to properly test the containerized application, so that Docker deployments work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the Docker image THEN the system SHALL use proper build context and tags
2. WHEN testing the Docker container THEN the system SHALL verify the application starts correctly
3. WHEN Docker tests pass THEN the system SHALL indicate successful containerization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the mirror workflow to be secure and reliable, so that repository mirroring works without exposing sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mirroring to GitLab THEN the system SHALL use secure credential handling
2. WHEN pushing to remote repositories THEN the system SHALL handle authentication errors gracefully
3. WHEN updating README badges THEN the system SHALL only commit changes if badges are actually missing
4. WHEN mirror operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the workflows to have proper error handling and logging, so that I can debug issues when they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflow steps fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
2. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL indicate which dependencies failed to install
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL show detailed test output for debugging
